## Abstract

Existing Human-Object Interaction (HOI) Detection approaches have achieved great progress on non-rare classes while rare HOI classes are still not well-detected. In this paper, we intend to apply human prior knowledge into the existing work. So we add human-labeled rules to ***PaSta*Net** and propose ***Rb-PaSta*Net** aimed at improving rare HOI classes detection. Our results show a certain improvement of the rare classes, while the non-rare classes and the overall improvement is more considerable.
